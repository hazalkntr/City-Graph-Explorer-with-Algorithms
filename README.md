# City Graph Explorer

This project was developed to deepen understanding of graph algorithms and their real-world applications, such as city navigation and route optimization. Using an undirected, weighted graph with adjacency lists, it builds a dynamic representation of city connections, allowing users to find the k closest cities and compute the shortest paths using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The project employs STL containers (vectors, maps, priority queues) for efficient data handling, focusing on performance and modular design.<br><br>

By implementing and optimizing these algorithms in C++, the project strengthened my algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills, providing hands on experience with essential graph techniques. Robust error handling and an interface ensure a smooth user experience, while the underlying data structures and algorithms emphasize scalability and efficiency, critical for applications in urban planning and logistics.<br><br>
